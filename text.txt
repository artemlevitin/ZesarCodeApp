A (measurement) unit is here represented by a single word containing only lower-case letters. All units are written as singular both in input and in output. A conversion fact relates the size of two units.
You are to convert a quantity in one unit to the equivalent quantity in a different unit using only a given set of conversion facts. These conversion facts are self consistent; there is never more than one conversion chain from any unit to any other unit.
